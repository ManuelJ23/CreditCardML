# Default of Credit Card Clients - Machine Learning Project

## Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting whether a credit card client will default on their payment next month using a classification model.  

It is divided into two main parts:  
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** An initial review of the dataset, exploring its structure, data distribution, and any potential issues such as missing values.  
2. **Model Development:** After preparing the dataset, a logistic regression model is built to classify clients based on their likelihood of defaulting.

## Dataset

The dataset used is titled **"Default of Credit Card Clients"**, available in the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/350/default+of+credit+card+clients).

## Results and Conclusions

The logistic regression model achieved reasonable accuracy in predicting payment defaults, highlighting key variables such as payment history and credit utilization as important predictors. However, further improvements could be made by exploring additional models or tuning hyperparameters. The analysis provides valuable insights into the characteristics of clients likely to default.

## Requirements

Make sure to install the following libraries before running the notebook:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
```

## How to Run
1. Download the dataset and place it in the project directory.
2. Open the notebook file (Credit Card ML Project.ipynb) in Jupyter Notebook or another compatible environment.
3. Execute the cells sequentially to analyze the data and train the model.
